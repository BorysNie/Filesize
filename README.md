# Create a specific size file.
This program creates a file of a certain size defined by the user. Once the program is run, the user is asked to input a valid number. 
This creates a file named <nr-inputed-by-user>MB (.txt - extension is optional depending on the language) 

More to come in other languages!

Please feel free to let me know if there is a way to simplify the code even further.
